          The Evolution of Intelligence
          <br />
          <br /> Testing The study of intelligence and the quest to measure it
          scientifically have deep historical roots. Over time, the tools and
          methods used to evaluate intelligence have evolved significantly,
          influenced by pioneering researchers and shifting societal needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Early Exploration: <br />
          <br />
          Sir Francis Galton Sir Francis Galton, a British scientist and cousin
          of Charles Darwin, was one of the first to delve into the study of
          individual differences in mental ability. He believed that
          intelligence was hereditary and conducted studies comparing people's
          awards and accomplishments. Galton hypothesized that mental ability
          could be assessed through physical measurements such as reaction time,
          sensory perception, and other physiological traits. Although these
          methods are now outdated, his research laid the groundwork for future
          inquiries into intelligence and inspired the development of more
          robust tools. Suggested Picture: Sir Francis Galton. <br />

          The Birth of Modern Testing: <br />
          <br />
          Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon In the early 20th century, Alfred
          Binet, a French psychologist, made a significant breakthrough when he
          was tasked by the French government to identify children in public
          schools who might struggle academically. Together with his colleague
          Theodore Simon, Binet developed a test that assessed practical
          knowledge, memory, reasoning, vocabulary, and problem-solving skills.
          This approach was a marked improvement over Galton's sensory tests,
          which had proven ineffective predictors of academic success. Binet and
          Simon also introduced the concept of mental age, which compared a
          child's performance to the average performance of children in the same
          age group. For example, a child scoring at the level of an average
          12-year-old would be said to have a mental age of 12, regardless of
          their chronological age. Binet’s work laid the foundation for modern
          intelligence testing, though his test was not widely used in France.

          <br /> Introduction to the United States: <br />
          <br />
          Henry Goddard Henry Goddard, an American psychologist, was
          instrumental in bringing Binet’s work to the United States. He
          translated the test into English and used it primarily to assess
          individuals for mental disabilities. Although his work contributed to
          the spread of intelligence testing, it also became entangled with the
          eugenics movement of the early 20th century, a controversial legacy
          that casts a shadow on the history of intelligence assessment.

          Standardization: Lewis Terman and the Stanford-Binet Scale <br />
          <br />
          Lewis Terman, a psychologist at Stanford University, adapted Binet’s
          test for broader use, particularly among adults. In doing so, he
          introduced the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, which became the
          standard for intelligence testing in the United States. Terman refined
          the scoring system by introducing the intelligence quotient (IQ),
          inspired by the work of German psychologist William Stern. Stern's
          formula for IQ involved dividing a person’s mental age by their
          chronological age and multiplying the result by 100. For example: A
          10-year-old with a mental age of 12 would have an IQ of 120 (12/10 ×
          100). A 10-year-old with a mental age of 8 would have an IQ of 80
          (8/10 × 100). While effective for measuring intelligence in children,
          this formula proved less useful for adults, as intelligence levels
          tend to plateau in adulthood. Suggested Pictures: Lewis Terman and
          William Stern.

          <br /> Modern Intelligence Testing <br />
          <br />
          Recognizing the limitations of the original IQ formula, modern
          intelligence tests have shifted to comparing an individual's
          performance against others in their age group. These tests, such as
          the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), define the average score
          as 100, with standard deviations determining whether a score is above
          or below average. Today’s intelligence tests incorporate various
          subtests measuring verbal reasoning, logical problem-solving, spatial
          skills, and working memory. Unlike early tests, they are designed to
          provide a comprehensive view of cognitive ability across multiple
          domains. <br />
          <br />
          Beyond Traditional IQ <br />
          <br />
          In recent decades, the definition of intelligence has expanded beyond
          what traditional IQ tests measure. Theories such as Howard Gardner’s
          Multiple Intelligences and Robert Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory of
          Intelligence emphasize diverse cognitive abilities, including
          emotional, creative, and practical intelligence. These perspectives
          argue that human intelligence is multidimensional and cannot be fully
          captured by a single number.
